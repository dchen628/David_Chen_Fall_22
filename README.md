# Spaceships

## Description

Growing up, I have always enjoyed playing games in my free time. Whether it be on my phone, my first gaming console, or my computer,
I continuously immerse myself in thrilling virtual worlds and adventures created by game developers. As such, I've always wondered about
the process behind game creation. Eventually, this led me to take the game engine course offered by my college, furthering my interest and understanding of game development.

In this project, I wanted to create a simple yet flexible tool that simplifies the process of game development and allows developers to create a wide range of games.
This game engine solves the challenges faced by many game developers by offering a comprehensive set of tools, optimizing game performance, and streamlining the game development processes.

During the project, I gained knowledge in software architecture, graphics programming, object collision, and file linking.
The project broadened my technical expertise and also deepened my understanding of game engine design.
