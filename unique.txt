[The Game]
Added a basic background image for the space theme game.

Player(aircraft) is able to move around using the arrow keys as well as WASD keys.

Added a firing key[spacebar], which allows the player to shoot a projectile.

The projectile can only be fired once, and can be fired again whenever it is off the screen.

The projectile leaves the front of the player aircraft at the position when spacebar is pressed.

There is an enemy red aircraft constantly moves right until it touch the right edge of the screen and
then it moves the opposide direction until it touch the left edge of the screen and repeat.

Whenever the players projectile hit the enemy red aircraft, the score on the bottom left will increase by 1.

The enemy aircraft will also show an explosion for 3 second before being spawned at the same height,
but a random x location.

After every 5 score, the enemy movement speed will increase by 1, the enemy speed starts off at 5.

There is a max speed for the enemy movement speed which is capped at 20.

The game continues to go on until player exit out of the game.
